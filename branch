Explain what a branch is, in your own words:
A branch is a copy of the full repository to which you can make/add changes, and then later push these changes upstream to the main repository.

If changes to the repository were made, then the branch's changes will have to be merged with the new additions since the original respository was checked ou.
This difference between a clone and a branch is, a clone is a full copy of a repository but changes can't automatically be pushed upstream to modify the head (latest) version of the repository (without specific permission from the owner). Whereas, a branch allows those upstream merges
